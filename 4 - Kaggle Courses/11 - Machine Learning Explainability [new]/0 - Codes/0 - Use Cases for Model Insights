Questions to Analyse:

\ What features in the data did the model think are most important?

\ How does each feature affect the model's predictions in a big-picture sense (what is its typical effect when considered over a large number of possible predictions)?

\ For any single prediction from a model, how did each feature in the data affect that particular prediction?
